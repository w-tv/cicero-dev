# Cicero

> â€”Cicero

Cicero (pronounced "KICK arrow") is an app we built using, and currently hosted by, streamlit; it's a frontend that we use to construct and send prompts to our backend. It should hopefully be easy to use for an end-user who doesn't know much about technology but is familiar with this industry. It's currently available on https://cicero.streamlit.app/ although this may not be true later.

Edit `streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire. However, it should be pretty much entirely as customized as we need it to be, at this point. Maybe a couple features left.

If you have any questions about streamlit, checkout its [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io). If you have any questions about Cicero, he wrote some books you can read.

And remember: the first thing to do is get the best of both worlds. You can!

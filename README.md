Cicero (pronounced "KICKer owe"Â¹) is an app we built using, and currently hosted by, streamlit; it's a frontend that we use to construct and send prompts to our backend. It should hopefully be easy to use for an end-user who doesn't know much about technology but is familiar with this industry. It's currently available on https://cicero.streamlit.app/ although this may not be true later.

UPDATE/TODO: we should add a section to this document explaining cicero.targetedvictory.com and cicero-dev.targetedvictory.com; the trgdv-msvc stuff; the secrets in the secrets-toml (and how you need to ask SMC to get added to the list of people who can view and edit the secrets); how you have to ask Maxwell Oppong to add people to okta app access so they can get there; and maybe how the docker file works; and maybe all the knowledge transfer stuff Sean talked about in the recorded meeting; and, once it settles, all the different branches and repos we keep track of, and how the deploys to tv.com are so long that if you deploy to tv prod during business hours this causes people random errors ("This page does not exist, redirecting you to the main page" or something like that) for like the following hour. Don't deploy to prod during business hours 9am-5pm ET (unless there's a crucial error in prod and someone asks you to); push to prod on like thursdays after work, usually.

Currently, you need to have git installed to properly set up this program (since the requirements.txt specifies a git repo dependency that is a hotfix we need, of a different dependency). This is unfortunate. However, the repo is already a git repo so you probably have git installed anyway hopefully?

To host Cicero, you will need a file, secrets.toml, to be placed in the .streamlit/ folder in this repo. This tells the code what the DATABRICKS_HOST, DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH, and DATABRICKS_TOKEN (the databricks api access token) are, as well as the aud value for google iap. It would also contain google sign-in information if we ever implemented that again. For local, but not production, development, you should also set an email_spoof variable to some truthy value in order to bypass the Google IAP identity detection we usually do in the deployed application. Since this secrets file is basically a password, it shall not be checked into git. You will have to ask someone with the file, or generate your own (see https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/secrets-management for details on the later option). Note that you do NOT need such a file to merely use an instance of Cicero that someone else is running and serving to you as a webpage. But also, you don't need to read this readme if you just want to use someone else's Cicero. This readme is about running Cicero. Also, if you're hosting Cicero on Streamlit (Streamlit Community Cloud), which we are, you don't use a file to enter the secrets, you enter them this other way, and will not need to create a file yourself: https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management

Access to the version of Cicero hosted on the Streamlit Community Cloud on https://cicero.streamlit.app/ is controlled through a whitelist of emails that you can ask to be added to. After a user is added to this, or given okta access through Maxwell Oppong, then you should add an entry to the user_pod table saying what "pod" they are in (this is some kind of business thing, like a group, that I don't really understand. I just input what the boss tells me.). You can use the databricks sql query composer to do this, or you can use New Pod Key tool in the Cicero app in dev mode, which will give you enticing buttons to click, and is a slightly more comfortable experience, although it is also extremely developer-internal-tool-y.

There are a number of databases on the backend Cicero relies on. Sometimes, like the activity log, Cicero will create the table if it doesn't exist. Sometimes, you must manually create the table in your backend, because that data is crucial and Cicero has no way to create the data itself (Cicero the app, just being the frontend, doesn't have any way to tell you who the permitted user accounts are, for example).

Local development on cicero uses the following three batch scripts, which are also working bash scripts:
* run.bat (installs requirements and launches the program. Quick, and with minimal hassle!)
* typecheck.bat (typechecks the project)
* reqcheck.bat (tries to check if we have any spurious dependencies in our requirements.txt)

The python version Cicero currently uses in production is 3.12 , specifically 3.12.4â€Š. It can probably run in any version 3.12+ as well. The production app is up at https://cicero.streamlit.app/ . There is also a staging/active-development version up at https://cicero-dev.streamlit.app/ . This also has its own repo (a fork) that development is done in, instead of developing directly in prod. This would be a branch but streamlit community cloud only allows one deployment per repo. (We also would have called it cicero-staging, because it's our [staging environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Staging), but curiously streamlit community cloud has the rule "Custom subdomains can't include the term 'staging'.") It's good to upgrade our version of streamlit periodically; but, given that that's our production environment, the version is pinned in the requirements.txt to prevent surprises. Dev is also a proving ground, and typically it's a couple commits ahead of prod, just to give those commits a little extra time to have their flaws detected by users (some users use dev) if flaws there be, and then I push dev to prod and then work on a new batch of dev changes.

The current development workflow for this project is that changes are made in the dev(elopment) repo, and then once OK'd, that entire history is pushed to the prod(uction) repo. Patch notes may be created. If you are in dev, have the OK, and want to do the push to prod, here are the steps:

```
git remote add prod https://github.com/achangtv/cicero # Set prod as an additional upstream in my local-machine version of dev. Only have to do this once.
git push prod # This will push the current history to prod (instead of the default `git push`, which will still push to dev). If you need to push to a branch on prod with a different name than the local branch, you can use git push prod local_branch_name:remote_branch_name, where local_branch_name is probably master.
```

Note that the git history of this project is basically a straight line. As God intended. TODO: explain various git commands that allow you to keep on the right history, here. (Then again, you can always look up how to abandon your git history and use the upstream one...)

Edit `cicero.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire. However, it should be pretty much entirely as customized as we need it to be, at this point. Maybe a couple features left.

For compatibility reasons, NEVER use \ as a file path delimiter (example: "assets\CiceroChat_800x800.jpg"); ALWAYS use / (example: "assets/CiceroChat_800x800.jpg"). Forward slash (â€Š/â€Š) is supported on more systems, and backslash (â€Š\â€Š) is also the string escape character in Python, which means if you use it your file paths might get messed up.

## Type signatures and typechecking

This project is typechecked! You can run typecheck.bat to check the types. If you are a novice python programmer or don't like types, don't worry; python is gradually typed so you can just ignore the types and it will be fine (typecheck.bat will probably fail for a while, however, until someone fixes it; but nothing relies on typecheck.bat passing). This project primarily uses mypy, and satisfies mypy --strict. This project also uses and passes pyright (also found in pylance and many configurations of VS Code), which provides slightly different coverage and thus is also good to have. This project also almost satisfies ultrastrict, a typechecking mode I made up where you aren't allowed to use typing.cast, type:ignore comments, nor the no_type_check and no_type_check_decorator decorators â€” the idea is that your types are then entirely statically verified, with a guarantee that your types are correct at runtime. There are a few places where we violate ultrastrict mode, but they are all bugs in something else that we are working around... sometimes the typechecker (sometimes our deps' type signatures).

Addendum on typing: the project has now adopted python-3.12-standard parameter type syntax, but in mypy "PEP 695 generics are not yet supported". So there will be type errors for a while. ðŸ˜©. Addendum on addendum: we have reverted to the old typevar syntax for an interim period.

When a typechecker works for our purposes, we add it to typecheck.bat, and have a party. This project also evaluated using pytype (via wsl), which has the apparent benefit of being able to deduce all types for you without annotations (?!) (can pyright also do this?) but it has some weird errors and is a couple minor python versions behind so eh maybe someday. Basedmypy also seems cool, but I worry it's too advanced, and its good feature might make the type signatures of this project too bespoke to it; maybe we'll use it some day anyway. Basedpyright seems about equivalent to pyright, but at least it installs its deps properly! (Edit: basedpyright has different features than pyright so we don't satisfy it so we aren't using it for now.)

A lot of static typing in this project is, as it were, lost, on the barrier between us and our database (sql_call). But it's probably ultimately fine.

Typechecking serves two, related purposes:
1. Code quality (in the present). Typechecking prevents type errors from occurring at runtime, and bothering our users.
2. Maintainability (in the future). Type annotations are one of the best tools we have, currently, against the degradation of code quality. It is the hope of this author that Cicero will be easy to maintain and extend in the future â€” as easy as possible (but no easier). The main way we achieve this is by cleverly writing less code, so there is less to go wrong later. But type annotations are another way. Now, unfortunately, the type annotations themselves are going to require maintenance, and this will be especially difficult if you are a novice python programmer â€” as most python programmers are. (Although maybe in an absolute sense it will remain easy.) So, if you find yourself unable to maintain the type annotations, you can let them go. This will decrease the future maintainability of the project, but can be a calculated sacrifice.

About 50% of the type errors we find are spurious and busywork and 50% are legitimate weird edge cases that it was good to alter the code to protect against. So, that's a pretty good ratio.

The python type system is relatively recent and not entirely complete, so sometimes it's impossible or very convenient to do something with the type signatures that we would like to do. Oh well.

## Labels of irksomeness

Various ridiculous workarounds in the code have been labeled FOO-BUG-WORKAROUND, where FOO is the name of the dependency to blame, in comments in the code. Eventually you may have the pleasure of removing these! You can grep for these.

Various things in this project have been labeled TODO, to eventually be dealt with. You can also grep for this. There is something weaker than a TODO, which is a Could, which just notes the possibility of developing in a different direction in the future. The idea is that all TODOs must be dealt with (even the ones that are just "figure out if we need to do this" and the sooner the better; Coulds can hang around indefinitely.

## Additional information about streamlit

If you have any questions about streamlit, checkout its [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io). If you have any questions about Cicero, he wrote some books you can read.

On an architectural note, we probably should not have used streamlit. It's a fine library, but it just abstracts over, and therefore repackages, html. This means using streamlit does not reduce the final complexity of our project. It also means that as we desire features that would be somewhat trivial in html+js, we have to wait for streamlit to provide those features to us (sometimes you can embed html+js into the streamlit page, but sometimes something about how streamlit works breaks this). The streamlit ImGui flow is also not trivial to reason about, which means that, to some extent, you have to "learn streamlit", much as you might "learn html". In the famous words of somebody or other, "Any problem can be solved with another layer of indirection. Except of course for the problem of too many layers of indirection."

## On variables

Regular variables are to be preferred over st.session_state variables, because static analysis tools work better with the former than the latter. That said, sometimes you need to use st.session_state variables; that's why it's even a feature.

Additionally, the use of fewer variables is preferred over the use of a greater number of variables â€” but not as strongly as the use of fewer magic values or computations is preferred over the use of a greater number of magic values or computations!

## Signoff

And remember: the first thing to do is get the best of both worlds. You can!

## Footnotes

Â¹ Scholars debate whether the i in Cicero's name would have been pronounced like the i in igloo or the ee in eek. Personally, I find the ee idea more plausible. However, all scholars agree that the Cs in Cicero's name are pronounced like Ks. In contrast, the conventional english name for Cicero is pronounced as though they were Ss. All of these variations may acceptably be used to refer to this project.

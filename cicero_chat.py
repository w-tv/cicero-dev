His running mate, JD Vance, was sworn in as Vice President at that time. Republicans secured a 52-seat majority in the Senate and retained control of the House, achieving a governing trifecta for the first time since 2018. It is now February 2025. Since taking office, Trump has been actively pursuing his policy agenda, implementing a series of executive orders and policies focused on immigration and border security, and pursuing a conservative agenda on issues such as trade, foreign policy, and government reform, with the support of Elon Musk's DOGE, which aims to root out waste and inefficiency in the federal government. His administration has also been embroiled in controversy over its handling of USAID, DEI policies, and cabinet nominations, and has faced numerous legal challenges and investigations, setting the stage for a contentious and potentially transformative presidency.\n"

altair == 5.4.1, >= 5.4.0 # I'm pretty sure streamlit automatically installs this, but we want to use a type-bug-fix that was first realized in 5.4.0. So, hopefully...
streamlit >1.39.0, <1.42.0 # We use a name or two from 1.37.0 and a typing from 1.38.0. Pre-1.39.0 a user test@test.com will occasionally be detected, even though this is just an internal test value, which is a harmless but annoying mistake. # In 1.42.0, streamlit adds auth, which changes the semantics of experimental_user. It may also simplify our auth code (that its point!) that was written before streamlit auth was a feature. It can even hook up with google. TODO: port us forward? Probably not hard.

databricks-genai-inference >= 0.2.3 # Currently, we pull down version 0.2.3 of databricks-genai-inference (the latest available as of time of writing, 2024-09-16). This, in turn, requires databricks-sdk 0.19.1 internally. Under python 12, databricks-sdk suffers from a minor defect that produces some warning messages from python: https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-py/issues/508 . This was fixed in version 0.31.0 of databricks-sdk. Hopefully, a later version of databricks-genai-inference will allow a later version of databricks-sdk. However, given that the pypi page for databricks-genai-inference says "[!IMPORTANT] We're preparing to release version 1.0 of the Databricks GenerativeAI Inference Python library.", it may be a while before we get a later version — I mean, on the other hand, it has said that on the page since literally the first release. But maybe they've gotten serious about it now. Also, it's free software but they don't list it on github or anywhere so I can't do a pr on it or anything.

wfork-streamlit-profiler == 1.0.0 # This is a fork of streamlit-profiler 0.2.4 that works on later streamlits. Some day we may move back to the original streamlit-profiler if it incorporates https://github.com/jrieke/streamlit-profiler/pull/4

google-auth-stubs >= 0.3.0 # These have a couple of type annotations we want for using google-auth, starting in 0.3.0 (technically google-auth tries to be typed as well, but apparently not very hard... (Later versions of the official library may have all of the types we need, in which case this logic will be removed from here. google-auth-library-python-BUG-WORKAROUND (in the sense that they don't provide types, but have a py.typed); after https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/pull/1588 is merged, we can remove the google-auth-stubs dep and just use the regular dep (see also: typecheck.bat))

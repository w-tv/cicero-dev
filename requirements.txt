uv >= 0.1.35, <= 0.1.37 # I'm not sure the exact version that added uv run, but that's really all we need. But then after 0.1.37 they changed the semantics of uv run or something so it doesn't work for me anymore. We'll just stay locked in to this range until uv run settles down a bit more, then we'll migrate over to the newer version.

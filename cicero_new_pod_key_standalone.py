Assuming you have the rest of cicero installed, you should run this using uv run streamlit run cicero_new_pod_key_standalone.py
This entire file is not needed for cicero, but reacts to a situation in which my boss kept updating the list of which people are assigned to which pod, and giving it to me as an xlsx. This file does all the stuff to do that.

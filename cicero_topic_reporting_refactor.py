"""This page performs a peculiar task known as "topic reporting", which is basically just summary statistics about various topic keywords (internally called "hooks").

List of derived quantities, left to right (does not include "topic", which is also there, but not derived per se):
  TV Funds: SUM of TV Funds
  FPM ($): SUM([TV_FUNDS]) / SUM([SENT]) * 1000
  ROAS (%): SUM([TV_FUNDS]) / SUM([SPEND_AMOUNT]) PERCENT
  Sent: SUM of Sent
  Result_Count: Count Distinct of Result Name

  (Since FPM is Funds per mille, I think the symbol should be $â€°, but Alex nixed this idea.)

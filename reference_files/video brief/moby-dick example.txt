Unrelenting obsession

Unending pursuit

Unwavering resolve

That's what drives me, Ahab, to hunt the white whale

If you don't elect me captain, Moby Dick will forever roam free

That's why we must set a new course

And re-elect me, Ahab, to command the Pequod

I will never rest until the beast is vanquished

And I'll put an end to the timid whaleboat leadership that has let Moby Dick escape for far too long

On election day, YOU need to make it happen

Elect Ahab to captain the Pequod, and together we'll harpoon the white whale.

here's the video brief google doc materials that I owed you:

    sample prompt https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwIsj_W5p7BgRvtaAKghQcgHqov6n_U_Y10Ih8HpmGU/edit?tab=t.0 Cicero Video Brief Build - Prompt 1.txt
    sample output https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2FepKKe25zc_1dV5zU3Pys8bUi5QMGbuE0bao0c0M8/edit?tab=t.0 Cicero Video Brief Build - Output 1.txt
    sample brief https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jZewVIkDhjKqaPaf5LITAjv0WNi6o3IcFMI3ZT3ExYo/edit?tab=t.0 Cicero Video Brief Build - Google Doc Output 1 - slightly doctored after download.html

the idea would be for (1) the sample prompt to go into Cicero and then yield (2) the sample output that then gets formatted in google docs and yields (3) the sample brieflet me know with questions!  we're excited about this one!

(note from wyatt: it is not important to generate 2 directly, that's just illustrative; only (3) is needed, from (1))

(another note from Wyatt: the hard part of this, I guess, is that google docs roundtripping is hard, since they don't really have a stable file format they offer, and I guess they're just incompetent or something. But we soldier on.)

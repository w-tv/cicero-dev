I am providing an example of good on-screen text and voiceover text and footage recommendations corresponding to a script.


Here is the script:
Washington’s reckless policies are holding Arizona back
But Juan Ciscomani is working every day to keep us moving forward by delivering common sense solutions for our communities
Juan is focused on cutting wasteful spending to lower inflation,
Easing the burden on our families while unlocking opportunities for all Arizonans
A proven leader, he always puts people above politics to ensure a brighter future for our communities
Vote Juan Ciscomani for Congress, and together we’ll build the Arizona our families deserve


And here is a frame-by-frame outline of the on-screen text and voiceover text and footage recommendations:

Using punchy language and breaking up the script into more frames instead of less in order to simplify the message and maximize impact, write me an outline that includes frame-by-frame on-screen text and voiceover text and footage recommendations corresponding to this script:
Broken promises
Higher costs
Open borders
That’s what Washington has given us
If you don’t vote in November, it only gets worse.
That’s why we must chart a new path
And elect a fresh voice like Tom Barrett to Congress
Tom will always fight for Michigan families.
And he’ll put an end to the radical policies making life worse.
On November 5th, YOU need to make it happen. 
Vote Tom Barrett for Congress

These scripts should let non-technical users push dev to prod, etc.

I guess they will need to install git and clone this repo; it's hard to figure out if there's a way this can be avoided.

Specifically, at least for now, all of these scripts are written assuming you've cloned the streamlit dev repo, https://github.com/w-tv/cicero-dev/

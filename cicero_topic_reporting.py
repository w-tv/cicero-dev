"""This page performs a peculiar task known as "topic reporting", which is basically just summary statistics about various topic keywords. To minimize RAM usage on the front end, most of the computation & filtering is done in the sql query, on the backend (nb: this is how SQL is supposed to be used).

List of derived quantities, left to right (does not include "topic", which is also there, but not derived per se):
  TV Funds: SUM of TV Funds
  FPM ($): SUM([TV_FUNDS]) / SUM([SENT]) * 1000
  ROAS (%): SUM([TV_FUNDS]) / SUM([SPEND_AMOUNT]) PERCENT
  Sent: SUM of Sent
  Result_Count: Count Distinct of Result Name

  (Since FPM is Funds per mille, I think the symbol should be $â€°, but Alex nixed this idea.) TODO: float this idea to others once Alex is gone.

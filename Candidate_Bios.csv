Now in his third term, Senator Rubio remains committed to serving the people of Florida and ensuring America remains a strong, resilient nation for generations to come. For Rubio, this is not a partisan issue, which is why he's developed a reputation of working across the aisle to pass common-sense reforms to strengthen our economy, communities, and families. It's why the Center for Effective Lawmaking ranked Rubio as the most effective Republican and the Lugar Center ranked him as one of the most bipartisan senators.

126,Michael Burgess,"Congressman Michael Burgess, M.D. practiced medicine as an obstetrician for 30 years.

Dr. Burgess has fought to repeal the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate since entering Congress in 2003, a goal that was achieved in the 114th Congress when both chambers overwhelmingly supported repeal. By voting to end a misguided policy that had been in place for almost twenty years, Congressman Burgess helped to ensure that seniors have greater access and better quality care from physicians, health care providers have more stable and predictable reimbursements, and buttress the fiscal health of the Medicare system as a whole. Congressman Burgess also recognizes the primacy of Constitutional principles and opposes federal overreach that wrongly encroaches on our rights, freedoms, and lives. Dr. Burgess believes that turning a blind eye towards immigrants who come to our country illegally is a disservice to those that seek to do so in accordance with our laws, and has worked to secure our borders while strengthening our commitment to enforcing those immigration laws that are already in place.
